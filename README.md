Advanced Python Calculator
This is an advanced Python calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project is designed to showcase not only the calculator's functionality but also fundamental concepts in Python such as user input, error handling, and control structures.

The project is structured to be scalable, allowing for future enhancements like scientific functions, a graphical user interface (GUI), history tracking, and more.

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling:
Handles invalid input gracefully, with user-friendly error messages.
Prevents division by zero with custom error handling.
Loop for Multiple Calculations:
Users can perform multiple calculations in a single session without restarting the program.
Clean Code Structure:
Modular design with separate functions for each operation.
Simple command-line interface for easy use.
Planned Enhancements
In the future, the calculator will include more advanced features such as:

Scientific operations (trigonometric, logarithmic, etc.)
A graphical user interface (GUI) with Tkinter or PyQt
Memory functionality (M+, MR, MC)
Calculation history tracking
Unit conversions and other advanced math functions
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SimpleCalculator.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd SimpleCalculator
Run the Calculator:

bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Usage
When you run the program, you will see a menu that looks like this:

markdown
Copy code
Simple Calculator
Choose Operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 
Example Usage
Select an Operation: Enter a number between 1 and 4 to select an operation.

1 for Addition
2 for Subtraction
3 for Multiplication
4 for Division
Input Numbers: After selecting the operation, you’ll be prompted to enter two numbers.

View Result: The calculator displays the result of the operation.

Perform Another Calculation: After each calculation, the program will ask if you want to perform another calculation. Type "yes" to continue or "no" to exit.

Sample Run
Here’s an example session with the calculator:

plaintext
Copy code
Simple Calculator
Choose operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide

Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10 + 5 = 15.0

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): yes
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 4
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 0
Error: Cannot divide by zero.

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no
Code Structure
The main calculator code is organized as follows:

Main Function (main()): Contains the main loop that handles user input, calls the appropriate functions, and handles the program's flow.
Operation Functions:
add(x, y): Adds two numbers.
subtract(x, y): Subtracts the second number from the first.
multiply(x, y): Multiplies two numbers.
divide(x, y): Divides the first number by the second (with error handling for division by zero).
Error Handling
This calculator handles several common errors to ensure a smooth user experience:

Invalid Input: If the user enters a non-numeric value for a number, the calculator displays an error message and prompts for input again.
Invalid Operation Choice: If the user enters a choice that is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, the calculator displays an error message and prompts for a valid choice.
Division by Zero: If the user attempts to divide by zero, the calculator displays a specific error message.
